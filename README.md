# TODO

# A list of things I want to add/practice to/in the project in no real order

- [x ] Use Json to store files, then pull them in as dataframes.
- [ ] Create Classes as much as possible
  - [ ] Decorators (You own)
  - [ ] @staticmethods
  - [ ] @ classmethods
- [ ] - Split Those Classes into separate files.
- [x ] `x, y = func(a,b)` This kind of thing.
- [ ] `func(*args, **kwargs)`
  - Packing and unpacking. Can put unlimited stuff in a function.
- [ ] Clean Code
  - [ ] List comprehensions
  - [ ] - Turnary Operators.
  - [ ] - Generators
- [x ] `if __name__= '__main__:`
- [ ] Add **color** to the terminal outputs. (Green : Good, Red: Bad, Yellow: Warn)
    - [Rich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrGFQp9njas)
        - Seems like the most flexible and diverse.
    - [Colorama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u51Zjlnui4Y)
- [x ] Make a Cli tool that does things without having to actually open the program
    - The [Typer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we3907q1xz4) module might be helpful.
- [ ] **Create a link between the main file and you bash script. This helps speed**
- [ ] Autocomplete Typing.
    - If you start typing "py", then autocomplete to "python"
    - Again, the typer module might be helpful for this
  ```python3
  conditions = [
  a > b,
  b > c,
  d > e
  ]
  print(true) if any(conditions) : else print(false)
  ```

# All in all, you want to fit as many tricks and cool concepts into this project. After all, this is just practice.
